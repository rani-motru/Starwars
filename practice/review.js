// Instructions: Follow the prompts and make sure to check your answer in the console. Some of the methods I am requiring for you to us we didn't do in class yet. That's on purpose, if you need assistance look back in lessons, and of course Google. :) 

// =================================================
//                     VARIABLES
// =================================================

// 1.) Declare a variable
let x = 7;
let t; //let allows to change the value and let is a blcok scope.
const y = 1; // the value will be const throughtout the program we cannot declare aa constant variable like this
            // const s;--> this cannot be done.
var z;   // allows to change the value but it is not used in JS.

// 2.) Change the value of this variable
 X = 6;
 console.log(X);

// 3.) Change the data type of this variable
   

// 4.) Create another variable and the one from above to concatenate

// 5.) Use any of the variables above or create new ones and print using string interpolation

// ================ Variable Names =================
